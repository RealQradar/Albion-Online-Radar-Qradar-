Frequently Asked Questions:
Is Qradar safe to use?
Qradar has been in the market for 6 months without detection and has avoided ban waves. However, usage is at your discretion and risk.

Does starting order of Qradar and game matter?
No, Qradar functions regardless of when you start it in relation to the game, and there's no need to run it as an administrator.

Can Qradar detect users who use invisibility items?
No, but Qradar will typically detect players before they can activate their invisibility, ensuring they cannot leave the radar area unnoticed.

Can I increase player detection distance?
Our radar only operates on the data sent by the server, and we cannot manipulate that data to increase detection distance.

Is Qradar compatible with different servers?
Yes, Qradar functions on both east and west servers.

How can I protect myself from a ban?
To minimize risks, avoid sharing your screen, discussing your use of Qradar, revealing in-game information from Qradar to untrusted parties, and refrain from discussing Qradar in-game.

Does Qradar work on systems other than Windows?
Yes, Qradar is compatible with both Windows and Linux.

I found a bug. How do I report it?
For best results, capture the issue in a video or screenshot and send us a private message or post it on the #bug channel.
